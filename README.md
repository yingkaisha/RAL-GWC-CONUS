## Introduction

This repository contains code that supports the data pre-processing, AI model training, inference, and result evaluations.

The AI model training and inference part is modified from the [MILES-CREDIT](https://github.com/NCAR/miles-credit) platform. The object-oriented verification was conducted directly using the METplus tool.
